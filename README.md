- ðŸ‘‹ Hello!, My name is James Hearn 
- I am a self-taught programmer, with a background in IT with a Computer Science Degree. It has been a few years since I've been in the field, but I am excited and eager to get back to the grind of computer programming.  
-  Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, C++, VisualBasic.Net, MySQL, JavaScript, and Python
-  Fun fact: I love to play Rhythm games, Puzzle games, team based communicative games, and simulator games. I also love to watch Anime and Reality competition shows.
